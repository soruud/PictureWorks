# Global Project Rules for PictureWorks

## Development Rules

**IMPORTANT:** All code changes must be automatically committed and pushed to GitHub after implementation. This is a project rule that must always be followed.

## Version Management

**IMPORTANT:** Version numbering and build rules:
- **Starting version:** v1.0.0
- **Version format:** MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.1.0, 2.0.0)
- **Version increment rules:**
  - Small changes/bugfixes: Increment PATCH (last number) by 1 (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
  - PATCH number can never be higher than 9 (1.0.9 → 1.1.0)
  - MINOR (middle number) increments when PATCH reaches 9
  - MAJOR (first number) increments ONLY when explicitly requested by user (for major changes/additions)
- **Never overwrite old versions** - always create new version files
- **Executable filename must always include version number** (e.g., `PictureWorks_v1.0.0.exe`)

When creating new changes:
1. Increment version according to rules above
2. Build executable (.exe) automatically with version number in filename
3. Commit changes with descriptive message
4. Push to GitHub automatically (important rule!)
5. Create new tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -a "v1.0.0" -m "Description of changes"
   git push origin --tags
   ```
6. Update version history/documentation if applicable

## General Guidelines

- Always update README.md when adding new features or making significant changes
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Test changes before committing

## Language Rules

**IMPORTANT:** All text must be in English:
- All text in README.md must be in English
- All text in the program/application must be in English
- All user-facing text, labels, messages, and documentation must be in English
- Code comments should be in English

## Build Rules

**IMPORTANT:** Build automation rules:
- **Always build to executable (.exe) automatically** after code changes
- **Executable filename format:** `PictureWorks_v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}.exe`
- **Example:** `PictureWorks_v1.0.0.exe`, `PictureWorks_v1.0.1.exe`, `PictureWorks_v1.1.0.exe`
- **Never overwrite existing executable files** - each version gets its own file
- Build should happen automatically as part of the development workflow
