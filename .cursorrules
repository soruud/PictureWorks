# Global Project Rules for PictureWorks

## Development Rules

**IMPORTANT:** All code changes must be automatically committed and pushed to GitHub after implementation. This is a project rule that must always be followed.

## Version Management

When creating new changes:
1. Commit changes with descriptive message
2. Push to GitHub automatically (important rule!)
3. Create new tag if needed:
   ```bash
   git tag -a "v1.0.0" -m "Description of changes"
   git push origin --tags
   ```
4. Update version history/documentation if applicable

## General Guidelines

- Always update README.md when adding new features or making significant changes
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Test changes before committing
