# Global Project Rules for PictureWorks

## Development Rules

**IMPORTANT:** 
- All code changes must be automatically committed and pushed to GitHub after implementation. This is a project rule that must always be followed.
- **After each version build:** Always commit automatically after building a new version
- **Only commit source code:** Never commit built files (.exe, build folders, etc.) - use .gitignore to exclude them

## Version Management

**IMPORTANT:** Version numbering and build rules:
- **Starting version:** v1.0.0
- **Version format:** MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.1.0, 2.0.0)
- **Version increment rules:**
  - Small changes/bugfixes: Increment PATCH (last number) by 1 (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
  - PATCH number can never be higher than 9 (1.0.9 → 1.1.0)
  - MINOR (middle number) increments when PATCH reaches 9
  - MAJOR (first number) increments ONLY when explicitly requested by user (for major changes/additions)
- **Never overwrite old versions** - always create new version files
- **Output filename must always include version number** (e.g., `PictureWorks_v1.0.0.exe`, `Plugin_v1.0.0.dll`)

When creating new changes:
1. Increment version according to rules above
2. Build finished product automatically with version number in filename (adapt to project type: .exe, .dll, .jar, etc.)
3. Commit changes with descriptive message
4. Push to GitHub automatically (important rule!)
5. Create new tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -a "v1.0.0" -m "Description of changes"
   git push origin --tags
   ```
6. Update version history/documentation if applicable

## General Guidelines

- Always update README.md when adding new features or making significant changes
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Test changes before committing

## Code Modification Rules

**IMPORTANT:** 
- **Evaluate the best approach** - Consider whether to modify existing code or add new code
- **Preserve existing functionality** - Always maintain working features when making changes
- **Avoid unnecessary duplication** - If modifying existing code improves maintainability and reduces duplication, do so
- **Refactor when beneficial** - Refactoring is allowed when it improves code quality, maintainability, performance, or reduces duplication
- **Test thoroughly** - Always test changes to ensure existing functionality is preserved
- **Document significant changes** - Explain why code was modified if it's not immediately obvious
- **Balance** - Choose the approach that best balances code quality, maintainability, and stability

## Code Organization and Documentation Rules

**IMPORTANT:**
- **Always maintain clean, organized code** - Keep code tidy and well-structured
- **Group related functions together** - Organize related functions in categories or sections for easy navigation
- **Use clear section headers/comments** - Mark different sections clearly (e.g., "Image Resize Functions", "File I/O Functions", "UI Event Handlers")
- **Add comprehensive comments** - Include good comments and explanatory text throughout the code
- **Explain complex logic** - Document why code does what it does, not just what it does
- **Prioritize readability** - Code length may increase due to comments, but this improves navigation and maintainability
- **Structure for easy finding** - Organize code so related functionality is easy to locate later

## Language Rules

**IMPORTANT:** All text must be in English:
- All text in README.md must be in English
- All text in the program/application must be in English
- All user-facing text, labels, messages, and documentation must be in English
- Code comments should be in English

## Build Rules

**IMPORTANT:** Build automation rules:
- **Always build to finished product automatically** after code changes
- **Product type depends on project** (e.g., .exe for Windows apps, .dll for BepInEx mods, .jar for Java, etc.)
- **Output filename format:** `{ProjectName}_v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}.{extension}`
- **Example:** `PictureWorks_v1.0.0.exe`, `LuckyDoorzPlugin_v2.4.5.dll`, etc.
- **Never overwrite existing build files** - each version gets its own file
- Build should happen automatically as part of the development workflow
- **Build to whatever the project requires** - adapt to the specific project type
